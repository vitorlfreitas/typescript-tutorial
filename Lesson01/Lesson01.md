# What is TypeScript?

According to the documentation:
> "TypeScript is a popular choice for programmers accustomed to other languages with static typing, such as C# and Java.
> 
> TypeScriptâ€™s type system offers many of the same benefits, such as better code completion, earlier detection of errors, and clearer communication between parts of your program." 

> TypeScript is a programming language built on top of JavaScript, in other words, **everything you can do with JavaScript you can do with TypeScript, and more**. TypeScript adds features to make our code more precise and it was developed to solve the problems that we all are tired of hearing someone saying about JS. TypeScript is a powerful tool to support us to write code more robust and more readable.

## Some of the features TypeScript brings are:
1. **Static Typing**
2. Enhanced Tooling Support
3. **Early Error Detection**
4. ECMAScript Compatibility
5. Open Source
6. Refactoring 
7. Code completion
8. Clean code
